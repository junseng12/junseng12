# 🌝 About Me

## Hi, I'm Junseung Lee 

> ## "Designing trustworthy, people-centered technologies that protect users in invisible ways."


I'm a senior student majoring in **Cybersecurity** at **Ajou University**, with a unique academic background that began in **Media & Communication**. 

I specialize in human-centered security infrastructure, with deep interests in:

- ### **Blockchain systems & smart contract security**
- ### **Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) & privacy-enhancing technologies**
- ### **Decentralized identity, IPFS, and zero trust models**
- ### **Cloud-native security & infrastructure architecture**


My long-term goal is to become a **researcher who builds real-world systems that protect people**, not just in theory but through transparent, verifiable, and robust architecture.

---

## 📌 Core Values

- **Security as Trust Infrastructure** — Technology must offer verifiable safety, not just performance.
- **People-Centered Design** — Systems should be intuitive, empowering, and privacy-respecting.
- **Real-World Grounding** — I prioritize hands-on validation through end-to-end system prototypes.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- ### ⚙️ Configure integrated test automation for all projects

Introduce unit + integration test automation for all projects, including Fabric-based chaincode and ZKP experiments

- ### 🔐 Design a ZKP-based security architecture system

Considering how to implement the current Zero-Knowledge Address Abstraction-based model as a specific system structure

- ### 🛠️ ZKP-based personal wallet authentication experiment

Design a zero-knowledge wallet that can be authenticated without external transactions and compare transaction records

- ### 📘 Upload diagram & structure description images for each project

Organize image visualization materials such as flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and structure diagrams and upload them to the docs/ folder

- ### ☁️ Configure Cloud-based security experiment PoC (AWS)

Configure IAM, authentication/authorization token flow, Zero Trust security model experiment project

- ### 📚 Configure experimental project branches based on paper reviews

Share records of structure design and project conversion based on papers read (zk-tree, ZKAA, etc.)

- ### 🧠 Develop ZKP experimental architecture prototype

zk-SNARKs structure as snarkjs, Circom, Experiment directly with one of Zokrates

- ### 📦 IPFS-based content addressing experiment project configuration

File storage, sharing, verifiable storage experiment project configuration

- ### 🏛️ Complete 1 thesis-based prototype before graduation

Organize experimental results before graduate school into a unit that can be published as a thesis
