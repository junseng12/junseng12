# 🌝 About Me

## Hi, I'm Junseung Lee 

> "Designing trustworthy, people-centered technologies that protect users in invisible ways."

I'm a senior student majoring in **Cybersecurity** at **Ajou University**, with a unique academic background that began in **Media & Communication**. I specialize in human-centered security infrastructure, with deep interests in:

- **Blockchain systems & smart contract security**
- **Cloud-native security & infrastructure architecture**
- **Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) & privacy-enhancing technologies**
- **Decentralized identity, IPFS, and zero trust models**

My long-term goal is to become a **researcher who builds real-world systems that protect people**, not just in theory but through transparent, verifiable, and robust architecture.

---

## 📌 Core Values

- **Security as Trust Infrastructure** — Technology must offer verifiable safety, not just performance.
- **People-Centered Design** — Systems should be intuitive, empowering, and privacy-respecting.
- **Real-World Grounding** — I prioritize hands-on validation through end-to-end system prototypes.
